# Cause of Fire Prediction
The dataset in question is that of wildfires in the USA. Our task was to model and predict the cause of the fire. The metric we were required to optimize is the weighted F1 score for all classes.

Please see final report of our project in FinalReport_ForestFires.pdf, and find implementation code in cause_of_fire_prediction.ipynb.
